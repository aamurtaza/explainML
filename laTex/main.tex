\title{Interpreting "Black Box" models with Explanations Methods}
\author{Adnan Ali Murtaza}
\date{\today}
\level{Thesis}
\abstract{
%The challenge is that machine learning models become complicated black boxes when applied on a large scale to solve business problems. Such models are not explainable to end consumers, which raises trust, transparency and privacy concerns. Interpretability and explainability try to solve this challenge; researchers have developed explanation methods which approximate the inner working of the black box model by taking model and testing instances as an input. However, a new challenge has appeared to evaluate explanations produced by explanation methods. In this research, we present a new statistical approach based on similarity measures to evaluate explanations. We tested our framework mainly on classification (binary, multiple, multi-class) problems, including numerical, categorical and textual datasets (iris, titanic, 20-newsgroup).

%\textit{Section Scope.}
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item \textit{Start introduction.}
%	\item \textit{Go through artificial intelligence, machine learning and the need of explainable machine-learning.}
%	\item - \textit{Add figure or diagram to show the relation among these fields.}
%\end{itemize} 
%\par Over a hundred years ago, scientists believed in a dream of having a computer programme who can think and learn like humans. Back then visualizing it would have been a mythical desire, but it is no longer an unrealistic aspiration. Artificial intelligence (AI) is now a growing arena, impacting on every aspect of research and business. Users do not often realize, but a simple Google search involves complex AI algorithms running behind the scenes. From intelligent software to automate routine labor or to make diagnoses in medicine, AI has a wide range of active experimentation topics and practical plans. \par
%Though most of the services and products are incorporating AI enhancements, often the core definitions of AI, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) conceive some confusion. \citet{Goodfellow-et-al-2016} provides thorough explanations which describe the relationship among these fields. A logical inference by a machine, based on a list of formal mathematical rules expresses an early concept of AI. In contrast to hard-coded rules, the capability of solving intuitive problems which involve an ability to learn from the knowledge, and make decisions is machine learning (ML). A simple machine learning algorithm can recommend a book based on user history, or it can filter an email as spam or legitimate. \par
%However, in real-world applications, algorithms require an in-depth representation of data to learn and decide. For instance, speech or image detection needs a sophisticated, approximately human-level recognition. Deep learning (DL) undertakes these problematic tasks; it builds a complex representation by combining simple concepts in a hierarchy, such as combining the corners and edges of a car image \citep{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}. Deep Learning also expands the horizons to solve complicated, real-time learning problems, e.g., autonomous cars, language translations, and chatbots. Such deep models are becoming more accurate in learning, though the explanation behind the predictive performance gets compromised \citep{lipton2016mythos, ribeiro2016should, lundberg2017unified}. \par
%Moreover, providing a consistent, human understandable explanation is nearly impossible when an algorithm complexity is substantial. Such models become black boxes which are hard to interpret, affecting user's trust, thus, raising many concerns about transparency and interpretability. Explainable machine learning addresses these problems and aims to make machine learning interpretable and understandable to everyday users. \par

%However, it is difficult in some cases where an algorithm complexity is substantial and providing a consistent, human understandable explanation is nearly impossible. Such models become black boxes which are hard to interpret and more vulnerable especially in high-security systems. An increasing amount of black box models have raised many concerns about their interpretability. Explainable machine learning (XML) addresses these problems and aim to make machine learning interpretability and understandable.


\subsection{Background} %\subsection{}
%\textit{Sub-section Scope.}
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item \textit{Explain the background of a problem.}
%\end{itemize}
%AIqballabs.ai has supported this thesis project, which adds valuable work to provides a new explanation evaluation scheme for state-of-art explanation methods. AIqballabs.ai is a digital initiative and platform about Artificial Intelligence and its ethical values. It aims to contribute and increase awareness of implementing explainable machine learning on a practical scale. It invites professionals and students from diverse backgrounds to participate and learn about how interpretability and explainability in Artificial Intelligence impact positively on our society.

\subsection{Motivation} %\subsection{}
%\textit{Sub-section Scope.}
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item \textit{Write motivation for selecting the problem.}
%	\item \textit{Write why its important to solve the issue.}
%	\item \textit{Write high-level definition of relevant sub-problem.}
%\end{itemize}
%An increasing amount of real-time intelligent services have established the user needs for trust and transparency. In simple cases, users simply put trust on a system and do not feel the urgency of receiving an explanation behind predictions, e.g. email spam filtering. However, in advanced applications, consumers desire to know the rational logic behind specific predictions. For instance, patients who use online medical assistants often require that how a certain medicine is predicted by a system. \par
%On the other side, critical services who are using intricate machine learning models try to provide explanations to non-technical users, but it is a challenging task. Due to lack of transparency, users perceive unclarity, which directly impacts on the trust factor and services. This research project aims to explore one of the piece of this challenging problem. It focuses on how existing explanations methods interpret machine learning classification models and how to evaluate and compare them.

\subsection{Social and Ethical Concerns} %\subsection{}
%\textit{Sub-section Scope.}
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item \textit{Write how machine learning and data usage is impacting society.}
%	\item \textit{Write how these new technologies raising social and ethical concerns.}
%	\item \textit{Highlight primary factors using some good examples.}
%\end{itemize}

%By its very nature, black box models are more vulnerable especially in high-security systems it is mandatory to place a debuggable and interpretable model. Moreover, after data regulations users demands for explanations has increased, pushing companies to provide transparency. Particularly in sectors such as insurance, health or banking it is crucial to interpret predictive models which assists in decision-making. It is also important to emphasize that companies who often receive personal data consent from users appear suspicious whenever they operate opposite to users consent \citep{lipton2016mythos}. For example, annoying advertisements on Facebook based on browsing history, rejection of a bank loan applications by a system often ignite the user's critical reasoning \citep{honegger2018shedding}. \par
%In such cases where a user needs to know the reason behind a specific decision. The ethical aspect of machine learning gives a user right to ask about an explanation. It is essential to provide and accommodate user when he/she has some discrimination concerns. European union general data protection regulation (GDPR) empowers data subject in such situations and place regulations restrictions on businesses to provide necessary explanations \citep{doshi2017accountability, goodman2017european} . Article 13 and 14 in GDPR asserts that a data subject which is included in algorithmic decision-making has the right to ask âmeaningful information about the logic involvedâ \citep{goodman2017european}.

%Increasing amount of these {\itshape Black Box} models are also raising societal and ethical concerns among communities. Intelligent machine learning models learn from the digital traces of people which serve as data features. Thus, in a case when a person needs to know a reason behind a specific decision taken by a system, which is his/her right as according to General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) \cite{doshi2017accountability}, how these {\itshape Black Box} models contribute? Most of the these are incapable of providing an answer because they are hard to interpret. \newline
%[ IMPROVEMENT REQUIRED Problems which are significantly essential to address are most often challenging to solve. Unfortunately, in March 2018 a self-driving car hit and killed the pedestrian in Tempe, Arizona \cite{uberselfdrivingcar}. Interpreting such Deep Neural Network (DNN) models can be very tricky due to the complex architectures, e.g. architecture for a self-driving car, probably manipulates millions of neurons and their activations which are difficult to interpret. This particular example is imperative because it also highlights the urgency of solving it. \newline IMPROVEMENT REQUIRED ]

%\begin{itemize}
%	\item \textit{Write about what are explanations in machine learning.}
%	\item \textit{Highlight how explanations in machine learning address societal and ethical concerns.}
%\end{itemize}

%In explainable machine learning, explanations established interpretability and transparency of a model by answering {\itshape "why question" } behind the predictions \citep{honegger2018shedding}. \citet{honegger2018shedding} further categorizes interpretability into three types: global model interpretability, algorithm interpretability, and local model interpretability. On the other hand, \citet{lipton2016mythos} suggests establishing interpretability by breaking explanations into two pieces, transparency and post-hoc explanations. First covers {\itshape "how the model works?"} and, the latter {\itshape "how much more model can tell about the predictions?"}. \par
%These questions focus on finding possible ways to enhance user's trust in model and trust in predictions. Indeed, the answers to these questions vary and depend on the application domain. However, several explanation methods have been proposed which partially gives explanations for the model predictions. Though, due to a lack of consensus on {\itshape "what is a good explanation?"} solving these questions are challenging.\par

%[ IMPROVEMENT REQUIRED To provide solutions to open {\itshape Black Box} models, researchers have suggested multiple frameworks and terminologies \cite{guidotti2018survey}.  \cite{lipton2016mythos} also categories the solution into two primary ways "transparency" and "post-hoc" explanations, first one covers the question of {\itshape "how the model works"} and, the latter one try to address {\itshape "how much more model can tell about the predictions."} 
%One important thing is also discussing the difference between {\itshape interpretability } and {\itshape explanations.} \cite{honegger2018shedding} provides this differentiation by stating that explanations established interpretability of a model by answering {\itshape "why question" } behind the predictions.
%Moreover, interpretable machine learning models are which can provide human-understandable explanations for predictions, thus can be called as {\itshape interpretable } models in contrast to {\itshape black box} models. \newline
%For many years, researchers have been actively working and proposing various methods to make {\itshape black box } models interpretable \cite{guidotti2018survey}. They further organize these methods into two classes: (1) Model Dependent Explanation Methods, which make black box model interpretable but tightly coupled with specific model architecture (2) Model Agnostic Explanation Methods; these methods are generalizable, thus, applicable to multiple black box models which deal with tabular, images, textual data. \newline
%Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) \cite{ribeiro2016should} and Shapely Additive Explanations (SHAP) \cite{lundberg2017unified} are few of the most prominent agnostic models identified in the literature \cite{guidotti2018survey,honegger2018shedding}, mainly provides the framework for local model interpretability, that is, producing a human-understandable explanation for a particular prediction. These explanation methods can open complex models such as DNN and work with several kinds of datasets.\newline IMPROVEMENT REQUIRED ]

\section{Methodologies} %\section{Three}
%\textit{Section Scope.}
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item \textit{Communicate about primary methodologies which are selected}
%\end{itemize}
This section explains the methodologies which are carried from research to measure explanations robustness. Explanations are generated using methods; Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) and Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) \citep{ribeiro2016should,lundberg2017unified}. To measure the robustness of explanations, local Lipschitz Continuity technique \citep{alvarez2018robustness} is implemented and tested out on UCI classification datasets.

On a high-level, the steps work as follow. 1) Predictive models are trained to perform classification tasks; these models behave as black-box models in the process. 2) Explanation methods interpret black-box models to find the reasons behind the predictions. 3) Explanations robustness is measured using local Lipschitz estimation technique \citep{alvarez2018robustness}.

Let $f_c: X \rightarrow y$ as a black-box classifier who classifies $x \in X; X = {\rm I\!R}^d$ to class $c_x; c_x \in y = \{c_1, ..., c_n\}$. Now, let $z \in X$ be an instance from input space which requires an explanation for a prediction $f_c(z) = c_z$. An explanation model $f_e(z)$ outputs an explanation feature vector $ e = {\rm I\!R}^d$ for which the estimation of robustness or stability is required. The main objective of this section is to define the notion of stability using local Lipschitz esitmation which requires a neighborhood $N_{\epsilon}(z)$ around an instance $z \in X$. Verbally, the notion of stability is the estimation of \textit{"how similar are the explanations for similar instances"} and vice versa indicates the notion of unstabiliy.

An overview of predictive models and explanation methods is presented in sub-section 3.1 and 3.2, respectively. Sub-section 3.3 defines and explains the robustness measure and presents algorithms used in the implementation.

%\end{itemize}

\subsection{Defining Similarity}\label{sec:defining_similarity} %\subsubsection{}
To formulate the explanation evaluation framework the pre-requistie is to specify a similarity measure. One trivial way is using euclidean distance which is an ordinary straight line distance between two points in euclidean space (wikipedia). For instance, in euclidean n-space the distance between two points $x = \{x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\}$ and $y = \{y_1, y_2, ..., y_n\}$ is:

\begin{align*}
d(x,y) = d(y,x) = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - y_i)^2}
\end{align*}

Using Euclidean distance choice, it is straightforward to define a small neighbourhood around any instance. However, estimating neighbourhood is challenging task itself, but euclidean distance allows us to find similar points trivially. The Definition~\ref{def:1} and Definition~\ref{def:2} formalize the notion of defining a ball of radius $r$ centered at instance $a$ as a neighbourhood policy. The subtle difference between the definitions is that closed balls contain all "exterior" points as compared to open balls.
\begin{definition}\label{def:1}{Let $a \in {\rm I\!R}^n$: Then the \textbf{Open Ball centered at $a$ with Radius $r > 0$} denoted $B(a,r)$ is defined to be a set of all points $x \in {\rm I\!R}^2$ such that $||x-a|| < r$, that is, $\{x \in {\rm I\!R}^2 |\;||x - a|| < r\}.$}
\end{definition}
Now, if n=2 then for each $a = (a_1,a_2) \in {\rm I\!R}^2$ and $r \in {\rm I\!R}^2$ where $r > 0$ we have an open ball centered at $a$ with radius $r$ is:
\begin{align*}
B(a,r) = \{x \in {\rm I\!R}^2\ : \sqrt{(x_1 - a_1)^2 + (x_2 - a_2)^2} < r\}
\end{align*}
%% Definition of closed ball
\begin{definition}\label{def:2}{Let $a \in {\rm I\!R}^n$: Then the \textbf{Closed Ball centered at $a$ with Radius $r > 0$} denoted $B(a,r)$ is defined to be a set of all points $x \in {\rm I\!R}^2$ such that $||x-a|| \leq r$, that is, $\{x \in {\rm I\!R}^2 |\;||x - a|| \leq r\}.$}
\end{definition}
And, if n=2 then for each $a = (a_1,a_2) \in {\rm I\!R}^2$ and $r \in {\rm I\!R}^2$ where $r > 0$ we have the closed ball centered at $a$ with radius $r$ is:
\begin{align*}
B(a,r) = \{x \in {\rm I\!R}^2\ : \sqrt{(x_1 - a_1)^2 + (x_2 - a_2)^2} \leq r\}
\end{align*}

Now, with having above definitions we can proceed to next section.

\subsection{Defining Explanation Evaluation Framework} %\subsection{}
The section attempts to define a robustness measure which seeks a variability in the explanations generated by interpretable methods for similar inputs. Intuitively, the idea is if a variation in inputs is subtle enough that it does not change the model's predictions, then it should not change explanations either. \citet{alvarez2018robustness} proposes a notion of robustness measure which forms the basis of this work.

The critical argument was that the understanding of a complex model using a single point-wise explanations might lead to a false understanding. One way to address this would be looking beyond the point of interest and covering its neighbourhood to examine the behaviour of a model. Therefore a crucial property such as \textit{robustness} is required to measure the explanations generated by the interpretability methods. It ensures that an explanation of a point is roughly constant in its vicinity regardless of the models (linear, tree-based).  In a simple form, it means that explanations for similar instances should not widely differentiate.

It ensures that an explanation of a point is roughly constant in its vicinity regardless of the models (linear, tree-based).  In a simple form, it means that explanations for similar instances should not widely differentiate.

It is visible that both LIME and SHAP explanations are stable for linear SVM model (top) but significantly vary for a non-linear two-layer neural network (bottom).}
	\label{fig:alvarez2018_robustness_figure1}
\end{wrapfigure}

Figure~\ref{fig:alvarez2018_robustness_figure1} presented in original work \citep{alvarez2018robustness} shows the explanations generated by LIME \cite{ribeiro2016should} and SHAP \cite{lundberg2017unified} for binary classifier predictions trained on a two-dimensional dataset. It explained that the explanations for a complex neural network model (bottom row) are often inconsistent and vary noticeably for neighbouring points. On the other side, explanations for linear SVM's predictions (top row) are relatively stable. This instability motivated the investigation of such a phenomenon and a need for an objective tool to quantify stability.

In light of this, Lipschitz continuity as function stability has been suggested to measure the relative change in output concerning the inputs. It measures the substantial relative deviations (global) throughout the input space. Since in the context of interpretable methods, explanations do not require uniformity for very distant inputs. Therefore, a local notion of stability (Definition~\ref{def:3}) has been proposed in the form of local Lipschitz continuity (Hein and Andriushchenko, 2017; Weng et al., 2018), which measure the relative deviations in a small neighbourhood input space.
\begin{definition}\label{def:3}{\textit{local notion of stability}:}
	$f: X \subseteq {\rm I\!R}^n \rightarrow {\rm I\!R}^m$ is \textbf{\textit{locally Lipschitz}} \textit{if for every $x_0$ there exist $\delta > 0$ and $L \in {\rm I\!R}$ such that $||x - x_0|| < \delta$ implies $||f(x) - f(x_0)|| \leq L||x - x_0||$.}
\end{definition}

In the Definition~\ref{def:3}, $\delta$ and $L$ are dependent on an anchor point $x_i$. It allows quantifying the robustness of the explanations generated by a model $f$ in terms of constant $L$. Usually, this term is not known, and it requires an estimation. One straightforward way to solve it for every point of interest $x_i$ is to do as an optimization problem (Equation~\ref{eq:1}).
%Computing this quantity is a challenge itself because a function is not differentiable end-to-end. The computation needs a restricted evaluation budget, and luckily there are various approaches off the shelf to manage computation expenses, i.e., Bayesian Optimization  (Snoek et al. , 2012, and references therein).
\begin{equation}\label{eq:1}
\hat{L}(x_i) = \operatorname*{argmax}_{x_j \in B_{\epsilon}(x_i)}  \frac{||f(x_i) - f(x_j)||_{2}}{||x_i - x_j||_{2}}
\end{equation}

Where $N_{\epsilon}(x_{i})$ is ball of radius $\epsilon$ centered at $x_i$. Using the formulation in \hyperref[sec:defining_similarity]{Section 3.3}, a neigrbourhood can be defined as below equation; This same form is used in the original work \citep{alvarez2018robustness} and it is noticeable that this relates to the closed ball Definiton~\ref{def:2}.
\begin{align*}
N_{\epsilon}(x_i) = \{x_j \in X|\;||x_i - x_j|| \leq \epsilon\}
\end{align*}  

%\begin{definition}{\textit{local notion of stability}:}
%	$f: X \subseteq {\rm I\!R}^n \rightarrow {\rm I\!R}^m$ is \textbf{\textit{locally Lipschitz}} \textit{if for every $x_{0}$ there exist $\delta > 0$ and $L \in {\rm I\!R}$ such that $||x - x_{0}|| < \delta$ implies $||f(x) - f(x_{0})|| \leq L||x - x_{0}||$.}
%\end{definition}

Now, moving towards algorithmic functionality, Algorithm~\ref{alg:Algo1} shows the implementation for local Lipschitz estimations used in various experimental settings. It takes 1) all the test-set points $ \in X$. 2) the explanations (attribution) vectors $f(X)$ generated by explanation model $f$  for all the test-set points $\in X$. 3) the value $\epsilon$ to define the radius.  It follows the intuitive strategy, iterates for each point of interest $x_i$ to find its neighbourhood (Algorithm~\ref{alg:Algo2}) and local Lipschitz value (Algorithm~\ref{alg:Algo3}) and put the value into an array of Lipschitz estimations. At the end of the iterations, it returns an array which contains the local Lipschitz values for all the test-set points.

\end{algorithm}

Similarly, Algorithm~\ref{alg:Algo2} also takes a simple approach to find the neighbourhood points for any instance $x_i$. Algorithm~\ref{alg:Algo1} calls it for every instance and passes 1) anchor point or point of interest $x_i$, which requires a local Lipschitz estimation 2) all the test-set points $ \in X$. 3) the value $\epsilon$ to define the radius. Given the inputs, it calculates the Euclidean distances from anchor point $x_i$ to all points in $X$. If the distance is less than or equal to $\epsilon$ then the point $x_j \in X$ is placed into an array of neighbourhood points $N_{\epsilon}(x_i)$. Finally, it returns the $N_{\epsilon}(x_i)$, which contain all the neighbourhood points from the anchor point $x_i$.

Algorithm~\ref{alg:Algo3} takes 1) anchor point or point of interest $x_i$, which requires a local Lipschitz estimation 2) the explanations (attribution) vectors $f(X)$ generated by explanation model $f$  for all the test-set points $\in X$. 3) the neighbourhood points from the anchor point $x_i$. It estimates the maximal local Lipschitz value for the anchor point $x_i$ by solving the (Equation 1) and outputs the computed value as $\hat{L}(x_i)$.

	\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

Now, at the beginning of this section mentioned that local Lipschitz estimation measure relative deviations inside the neighbourhood input space. It is helpful to use Figure~\ref{fig:alvarez2018_robustness_figure2} from \citep{alvarez2018robustness} that demonstrates how $\hat{L}(x_i)$ values computed using above mechanism describe the relative deviations. It supports the idea of choosing the worst-case deviation of any point of interest $x_i$ and reveals an example presented in Figure 2. For instance, the examples from the BOSTON dataset shows that however, the point of interests are incredibly similar, but their explanations by each method for the modelâs prediction vary considerably. It also depicts that maximizing equation (1) for $x_i$ measures relative deviation and allows us to enforce the robustness mechanism on explanations methods.

%Quick comment on Alg. 1: it is not clear from the algorithm what is being computed there. Presumably for each $x_{i}$ in X you want to compute maximal |f(x)-f($x_{i}$)|/[x-$x_{i}$| where $x \in N(x_{i})?$ You could also explain what the numbers in Tab. 1 are. The level of detail here is such that I could replicate your experiment, if I had the data and if I wanted to. E.g., you need to be more explicit in the algorithm and also define what you mean by âaggregationâ in Tab. 1.
